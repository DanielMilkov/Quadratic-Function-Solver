# Quadratic-Function-Solver
This is a java code that takes a quadratic function as input and returns the solution.

Enter your function as ax^2 + bx + c = 0
For example: 5x^2 - 9x - 2 = 0
output will be x = 2 and x = -0.2 

also you can put numbers after equal sign:
For example: 2x^2=-8x
output will be x = 0.0 and x = -4.0

BUT it does NOT accept fractional numbers as input. it WILL GIVE YOU WRONG ANSWER. in next update I will add this feature.
For example: 2.5x^2 - 8.5x + 1.35 = 0
output will be x = 2.9041594578792296 and x = 0.4958405421207705
but it's WRONG.

And it does NOT accept parentheses as input. 
For example: (x + 3)^2=0
output will be: It's not a quadratic function.
but it is.
